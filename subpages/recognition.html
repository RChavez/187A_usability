            Texty bit about teh screenshot. blahblahblahblah, UL uses an inclusive point of view on their webpages. This point of view is very useful S it can be interpreted in two ways. If the user is a member of the UL society, admitted or current student, faculty or staff, alumnus or donor- the use of second person words such as “our” and “we” make the user feel apart of the university. This may encourage a positive experience while browsing or searching the website.
However, as with most instances of second person use- a user who is not a member of the community may feel a sense of exclusion. 
Unclear Copy - unclear use of language for audience. Prospective student treated as a current student.
